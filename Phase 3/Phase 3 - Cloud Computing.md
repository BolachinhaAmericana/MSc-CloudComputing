# Pneumonia Detection App - Preprocessing 

#### Phase 3 - Functional requirements and application architecture 

## Functional Requirements

(1) Users are able to upload chest X-ray images (DICOM).

(2) All uploaded images are resized to a predetermined dimension of 224x224 pixels.

(3) This filter reduces some noise through the application of a Gaussian blur.

(4) The image contrast is enhanced by extending the pixelâ€™s intensity range from the original range to 0 to 255 (histogram equalization). 

(5) Preprocessed images are stored in the cloud.

As this project is focused on whole image classification, segmentation will be skipped.


## Application Architecture

#### Components

* Image upload component
* Preprocessing component
* Cloud Storage component
* Access Image component

#### Interactions between these components

* User uploads an image with a REST API (HTTP POST).
* The preprocessing component fetches the image with a gRPC framework.
* This image (already processed) is stored in the cloud storage component and the cloud storage be accessed with a REST API.
* The processed image can be accessed with a gRPC framework.


## Diagram of the Application Architecture


The diagram of the application architecture is represented below. 
The user uploads the image, an x-ray of a patient. This image is then sent to be preprocessed through several steps: resize, noise reduction, contrast adjustment and image cropping. The image is then sent to the image dispatcher that serves as an intermediary that receives preprocessed images, temporarily stores preprocessed images and manages image access requests. 
This way, when an image is requested it first checks if the image is stored locally: if it is, it gets sent to the access point; if it is not, it gets retrieved from the cloud storage - where it can be fetched by additional microservices - and only then sent to the access point where it can be accessed by the user (presumably a doctor) for additional examination and confirmation of results.
