1) Create a k8 cluster with 2vCPU and 8GB RAM (in a near region like europe west)
2) Enable workload identity, put the GET_METADATA (ask AI)
3) Bind the inference service account to the cluster (ask AI)
4) Put the right roles, object viewe, artifact reader in the service account if needed


then:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml #in the folder with the yaml
kubectl get svc xray-app-service

Any doubsts ask AI its not that hard to get everything jsut a bit of patience
