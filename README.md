### Business Capabilities:
- AI-assisted diagnostic of Pneumonic Patients

### Use Cases:
 1. Helping Doctors to achieve a diagnosis for their patients. 
By having and AI assistant to have a continuous look on the X-Rays of the patient this could help the doctor adjust his opinion on several other factors and/or symptoms the patient presents to achieve a faster and accurate diagnosis.

2. Acting as a second opinion on previous diagnosis.
    In some extreme cases where the Doctors could be indecisive of the diagnosis and assuming the tool wasn't used to reach the indecisiveness it could prove to be a second opinion.

3. Ease the understanding of the current situation to the patient and non-specialized individuals
    As there might be some difficulty explaining some medical concepts to patients and their families, this tool would present a way to simply explain the X-rays to the untrained eye
